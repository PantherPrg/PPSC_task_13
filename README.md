# PPSC_task_13: Rolling Shapes
**| difficulty: 8/10 |**

For your geometry class, the teacher Ms. Bart gives you a plastic bag of several shapes, the number of sides of each shape ranging from 3-6. Note that they are all equilateral, meaning all of the sides are of equal length for individual shape. You are also given the height of each shape, measured from the middle of the base to the tippity top when the base side is flat on the ground and the shape is stood vertically up. 

You are then asked to find how far it would travel if it were to roll one revolution. Find that distance. 

*use the round(num, places) function to round your answer to the hundredths* 

ex: # num of sides: 3, triangle

                /|\      imagine that this is equilateral
               / | \     height: 4 (don't mind the units)
              /  |  \
             /   |4  \
            /    |    \
           /_____|_____\

do some math: bitty bangy boom -> each side is ~ 4.62 long
travels 13.86
__________________________________________________________________________________
**Input**:
integer sides (number of equal sides the shape has)
integer height (how tall the shape is from base to tip when on a flat side)
__________________________________________________________________________________
**Output**:
float distance (how far the shape travels after one rotation)

Make sure to add a newline at the end of your answer for it to match the answer format.

**optional challenge: write your code in under 4 lines**

I already import the math library for you
note: the equations are taken in radians, so i already did the conversions for you: 

"""
math library 
sin syntax : math.sin((degrees * 3.14) / 180)
cos syntax: math.cos((degrees * 3.14) / 180)
tan syntax: math.tan((degrees * 3.14) / 180)
"""

This problem deals with MATH. it has a bit of math. ALSO, we deal with the **math** library for the first time. Pretty cool. **Do your research, google is your friend.**

For additional help, either ask Paul, Joshua, Mr. Blatner, or any other staff member for assistance. We would be able to go over them during the club. **It can be an anonymous request if you would like.**
